NAME
    Finance::Currency::Convert::KlikBCA - Convert currencies using data from
    KlikBCA/BCA

VERSION
    version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
     use Finance::Currency::Convert::KlikBCA qw(convert_currency);

     printf "1 USD = Rp %.0f\n", convert_currency(1, 'USD', 'IDR');

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  convert_currency($amount, $from, $to) => NUM
    Currently can only handle conversion *to* IDR. Dies if given other
    currency.

    Will warn if failed getting currencies from the webpage.

    Currency rate is not cached (retrieved from the website every time).
    Employ your own caching.

    Currently uses the Bank Notes rate.

    Will return undef if no conversion rate is available for the requested
    currency.

    Use get_currencies(), which actually retrieves and scrapes the source
    web page, if you need the more complete result.

  get_currencies() -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Extract data from KlikBCA/BCA page.

    No arguments.

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array). First element (status) is an
    integer containing HTTP status code (200 means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx
    function error). Second element (msg) is a string containing error
    message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third element (result) is optional,
    the actual result. Fourth element (meta) is called result metadata and
    is optional, a hash that contains extra information.

TODO
    *   Parse last update time
